<h1>Sharing repositories using Dropbox</h1>

<p>
<a href="./">Crystal</a> requires read-access to your co-workers' repositories.
This document describes how to do this via
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>.  
</p>


<h2 name="creating">Install Dropbox</h2>

<p>
Sign up for <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> and install the
application.
</p>

<p>
We will call the Dropbox folder <em>MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER</em>.
It is <tt>~/Dropbox/</tt>, under Unix-like environments.
</p>



<h2 name="create">Create the Dropbox folder</h2>

<p>
Only one person has to perform this step, but it must be performed before
anyone can use Dropbox.  If you are not responsible for this step, then you
should have already received an invitation to use the shared Dropbox
folder.  In that case, skip to <a href="#link">Link your repository to
Dropbox</a>.
</p>

<p>
In MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER, create a folder called PROJECT.
</p>

<p>
Follow the instructions at
<a href="#link">Link your repository to Dropbox</a> for the master
repository, using the folder name "master".
</p>

<p>
At <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">www.dropbox.com</a>, select the
PROJECT folder and click on "shared folder options".  Share the folder with
the other relevant users.  (You may also use the "Invite to Dropbox" link
from the "get started" tab on
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">www.dropbox.com</a> to send them an
official invite to Dropbox, but this is not necessary.)
</p>

<p>
Send email to your collaborators with a link to this document, and telling
them the name of the Dropbox folder.
</p>


<h2 name="link">Link your repository to Dropbox</h2>

<ol>
<li>

For each of your repositories, create a folder.

<p>
If your username is jsmith, and you have only have one clone
of the master, then you might create
<tt>MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER/PROJECT/jsmith</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If you have multiple clones, then create a directory for each one.  Here
are possible names:
<pre>
  MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER/PROJECT/jsmith-desktop
  MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER/PROJECT/jsmith-laptop
  MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER/PROJECT/jsmith-experimentalbranch
</pre>

</li>

<li>
Clone the master, or link an existing clone.  This step depends on your
operating system.

<ul>
  <li>
If you use Windows, then you must clone your 
repository from the master to MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER/PROJECT/jsmith, and use
that for all your work.
  </li>

  <li>
If you use a Unix-like system (Linux/Mac), then you can clone the
repository from the master to wherever you want.  Create a symbolic link
to that location in MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER/PROJECT/jsmith.  For example:
<pre>
  ln -s PROJECT_REPO MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER/PROJECT/jsmith
</pre>
where PROJECT_REPO is really your working copy:  the directory that
contains a <tt>.hg/</tt> subdirectory.

  </li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>
Tell your collaborators about the new MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER/PROJECT/jsmith/PROJECT_REPO
folder, so that they can add it to their <a href="#using-crystal">Crystal
    configuration file</a>.
</li>

</ol>


<h2 name="using-crystal">Using Crystal with Dropbox</h2>

<p>
Download and set up Crystal, as described at
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/brun/research/crystal">http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/brun/research/crystal</a>.
</p>

<p>
When you set up the configuration file, use each of your collaborators'
directories, such as
</p>

<pre>
  MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER/PROJECT/jdoe/PROJECT_REPO
  MY_DROPBOX_FOLDER/PROJECT/jqpublic/PROJECT_REPO
</pre>

<p>
If more users add their repositories to Dropbox after you set up Crystal,
then you will need to update the configuration file.
