<h2 id="motivation">Goal: Increased developer awareness of conflicts</h2>

<p>
The Crystal tool increases developer awareness of potential version control conflicts.  For example, it informs a developer of the answer to the question, &#8220;Might my changes conflict with others' changes?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Crystal keeps an eye on all the participating developers' repositories.  It informs each developer when it is safe to push her changes, when she has fallen behind and could pull changes from others or a central repository, and when changes other developers have made will cause a syntactic (or, soon to be implemented, behavioral) conflict.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If conflicts occur, Crystal informs developers early, so they may discuss and resolve these conflicts while the causes are fresh in their minds.  Long-established conflicts can be much harder to resolve.</li>
<li>If changes are made (locally or remotely) without conflicts, Crystal increases developers' confidence that the changes will not cause problems for the team.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Crystal examines commits.  It does not examine your working copy &mdash;
your uncommitted modifications.  The reason is that commits are more likely
to be coherent and desired units of work, for which notification about
(non-)conflicts is of value.
</p>

<p>
The Crystal client is now in beta and is available for <a href="#download">download</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="Requirements">Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">JRE (Java Runtime Environment).</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com">Mercurial</a>, version <b>1.6 or later</b>. (Crystal only supports Mercurial, for now.)</li>
<li> The fetch mercurial extension must be enabled.  To do this, add the following text to your hg configuration file: <tt>~/.hgrc</tt> on Linux, or <tt>mercurial.ini</tt> on Windows.  (There is nothing after the "<tt>=</tt>" in "<tt>fetch=</tt>".)
<pre>
[extensions]
fetch=
</pre></li>
<li> The more of your co-workers' repositories you have read access to, the
  more useful Crystal will be.  However, Crystal can be useful even if you
  only have access to your repository's parent.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="download">How to run Crystal</h2>

<ol>
<li> Download <a href="crystal.jar">crystal.jar</a>. (Current version is 0.1.20100801.  To learn the version of an executable, run <tt>java -jar crystal.jar --version</tt> or select the <tt>about</tt> menu in the GUI.)</li>
<li> Run:  <tt>java -jar crystal.jar</tt></li>
<li> The tool will complain that your configuration file is invalid and
  give you instructions on how to fix it.  You can do so either via a GUI
  that creates the configuration file for you, or by editing the
  configuration file directly.  See below for the
  <a href="#Configuration_File_Format">configuration file format</a>.</li>
<li> Restart Crystal.  Crystal will run as an icon in your task bar.  Click on the icon to see the full client and more options.</li>

<p>
In the task bar, Crystal displays the most severe icon that appears
anywhere in the full window.
</p>


<h2 id="Configuration_File_Format">Configuration file format</h2>

<p>The Crystal configuration file is an XML file that describes the locations of the scratch space and the <tt>hg</tt> executable, as well as contains information on the repositories crystal monitors.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example valid configuration file:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ccConfig tempDirectory=&quot;C:/temp/conflictClient/&quot; hgPath=&quot;C:/Program Files/TortoiseHg/hg.exe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;project Kind=&quot;HG&quot; ShortName=&quot;MyFirstProject&quot; Clone=&quot;C:/projects/MyLocalFirstProjectRepo/&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source ShortName=&quot;MASTER&quot; Clone=&quot;ssh://user@host/path/to/repo/&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;source ShortName=&quot;Friend&quot; Clone=&quot;ssh://user@host/path/to/friend/repo/&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/project&gt;
  &lt;project Kind=&quot;HG&quot; ShortName=&quot;MySecondProject&quot; Clone=&quot;C:/projects/MyLocalSecondProjectRepo/&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source ShortName=&quot;MASTER&quot; Clone=&quot;ssh://user@host/path/to/socond/project/repo/&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;source ShortName=&quot;Friend&quot; Clone=&quot;ttps://user@host/path/to/friend/second/repo&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/project&gt;
&lt;/ccConfig&gt;
</pre>

<p>
At the root level, there is a single XML element: <tt>ccConfig</tt>.  This element has two attributes: <tt>tempDirectory</tt> and <tt>hgPath</tt>.  These attributes show the path to the scratch space and the hg executable, respectively.
</p>

<p>
For each project you wish Crystal to track, <tt>ccConfig</tt> will have a <tt>project</tt> child with three attributes: <tt>Kind</tt>, <tt>ShortName</tt>, and <tt>Clone</tt>.  The <tt>Kind</tt> element describes the kind of the repository: HG for mercurial or GIT for git, although, for now, Crystal only supports HG.  The <tt>ShortName</tt> element is the name of the project you want Crystal to display (on the left side on the screen shot above).  The <tt>Clone</tt> element is the path to your local repository; you can put any address that can legally go after the <tt>&quot;hg clone&quot;</tt> command.
</p>

<p>
Finally, for each repository you wish Crystal to compare to your repository, the <tt>project</tt> element will have a <tt>source</tt> child with three attributes: <tt>Kind</tt>, <tt>ShortName</tt>, and <tt>Clone</tt>.  The <tt>Kind</tt> element is identical to the parent <tt>project</tt>'s <tt>Kind</tt> element.  The <tt>ShortName</tt> element is the name of the repository you want Crystal to display (above the icons on the screen shot above).  The <tt>Clone</tt> element is the path to this repository; again, you can put any address that can legally go after the <tt>&quot;hg clone&quot;</tt> command.
</p>

<h2 id="access-to-remote-repos">Making your repository available to your co-workers</h2>

<p>
The more of your co-workers' repositories you have read access to, the
more useful Crystal will be.  This section explains how to make your
repositories (your clones) available to a co-worker.
The two basic ways are via a file system or via http.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>File system sharing</dt>
<dd>
If you and your co-worker have access to the same file system, then you can
store your repository in a place where your co-worker can read it.

<ul>
<li>
If you already do your work on that shared file system, then you can just
grant your co-worker read permission to your repository.

<p>
If changing permissions is difficult, then you can periodically copy your
repository to a location that your co-worker can read.  The more frequently
you do this, the more useful Crystal is.  Here is a line you can place in
your crontab file to automate the task:
</p>
<pre>
# Update a public copy of a .hg directory every minute.
* * * * *	\cp -fpru .../path-to-repo/.hg .../accessible-path
</pre>
(The <tt>.hg</tt> file will end up as <tt>.../accessible-path/.hg</tt>, and
the path to the repository is just <tt>.../accessible-path</tt>.)
</li>
<li>
If you do your work on a different file system, you will need to copy your
work periodically to the shared file system.  Tools that you might find
useful include <tt>scp</tt>, <tt>rsync</tt>, or <tt>unison</tt>.  Again,
automating this task is easiest for you and most useful to your co-workers.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Http sharing</dt>
<dd>
The http sharing approach is often easier, but it only works if you have
access to a machine that runs a web server.

<p>
Store your repository in a location that is accessible from the web &mdash;
that is, a directory that has a <tt>http:</tt> URL.  You can
make a symbolic link from your <tt>~/public_html</tt> directory (this may
requires changing access permissions so the web server can read your
repository), or periodically make a local or remote copy as described above.
</p>
</dd>
